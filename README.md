This is a [Streamlit app](https://darren7753-numerical-methods-app-0nzaef.streamlit.app/) that enables users to calculate the roots of equations using numerical methods. For those who are not familiar with numerical methods, you can refer to the [PDF file](https://github.com/darren7753/numerical_methods/blob/main/Numerical%20Methods.pdf) provided. Currently, the app includes the following methods:

- Bisection
- False Position
- Newton-Raphson
- Secant

More methods may be added in the future.
